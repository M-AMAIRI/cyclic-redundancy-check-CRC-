# cyclic-redundancy-check-CRC-


CRC implementation :

A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks
and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. 

A CRC-enabled device calculates a short, fixed-length binary sequence, known as the check value or CRC, for each block of data to be sent or stored and appends it to the data, forming a codeword.
